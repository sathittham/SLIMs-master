/**
 * An implementation of the Android Developer low-pass filter. The Android
 * Developer LPF, is an IIR single-pole implementation. The coefficient, a
 * (alpha), can be adjusted based on the sample period of the sensor to produce
 * the desired time constant that the filter will act on. It is essentially the
 * same as the Wikipedia LPF. It takes a simple form of y[0] = alpha * y[0] + (1
 * - alpha) * x[0]. Alpha is defined as alpha = timeConstant / (timeConstant +
 * dt) where the time constant is the length of signals the filter should act on
 * and dt is the sample period (1/frequency) of the sensor.
