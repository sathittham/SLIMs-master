/**
 * An implementation of the Wikipedia low-pass filter. The Wikipedia LPF, is an
 * IIR single-pole implementation. The coefficient, a (alpha), can be adjusted
 * based on the sample period of the sensor to produce the desired time constant
 * that the filter will act on. It takes a simple form of y[i] = y[i] + alpha *
 * (x[i] - y[i]). Alpha is defined as alpha = dt / (timeConstant + dt);) where
 * the time constant is the length of signals the filter should act on and dt is
 * the sample period (1/frequency) of the sensor.
